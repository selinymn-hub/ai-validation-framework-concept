# AI-Enabled Validation Framework (Concept)

Vendor-agnostic example showing how ML-assisted validation can
prioritize tests, flag anomalies, and speed release cycles â€” **without** any proprietary data or code.

## Why it matters
Traditional validation means manually checking hundreds of runs and plots.  
This concept uses historical labelled results to predict **instability risk** and classify outcomes, so engineers focus where it matters.
